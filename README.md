Welcome to my new and improved personal portfolio website! Hopefully this time I can get a 'REACT'-ion! Ha! Did you get my joke? React-ion! Because I wrote it in react this time. After 3 hours spent on trying to figure out how to properly put scrollbars in each of my cards, I'm pissing my pants laughing.

I refuse to take criticism about the comic sans. It was an informed design choice.
